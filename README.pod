=head1 NAME

App::RewriteVersion - A tool to update your Perl module versions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use App::RewriteVersion;
 my $app = App::RewriteVersion->new;
 
 # Options
 $app->verbose(1)->follow_symlinks(0);
 
 # Bump versions for modules in current dist directory
 $app->update_versions(bump => 1);
 
 # Bump versions in specified dist directory
 $app->update_versions(dir => 'Foo-Bar/', bump => 1);
 
 # Override module to read version from
 $app->update_versions(version_from => 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm', bump => 1);
 
 # Don't bump, just synchronize versions with main module
 $app->update_versions(bump => 0);
 
 # Custom version bump algorithm
 $app->update_versions(bump => sub { shift + 0.05 });
 
 # Set versions to specified version (or use the V environment variable)
 $app->rewrite_versions(version => '0.065');
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<App::RewriteVersion> is a tool for managing Perl module versions in a
distribution. It is heavily based on the L<Dist::Zilla> plugin
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RewriteVersion>. Similarly to that plugin, the C<V>
environment variable can be used to override the version used for rewriting.
Existing version assignments and new versions must be parseable with the same
rules as in L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RewriteVersion/"DESCRIPTION">.

See L<perl-rewrite-version> and L<perl-bump-version> for details on
command-line usage.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 allow_decimal_underscore

 my $bool = $app->allow_decimal_underscore;
 $app = $app->allow_decimal_underscore(1);

If true, decimal versions with underscores will be allowed. Defaults to false.
As with L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RewriteVersion>, version tuples with underscores
are never allowed.

=head2 dry_run

 my $bool = $app->dry_run;
 $app = $app->dry_run(1);

If true, the module will process files as normal but not actually modify them.
Useful with L</"verbose"> to verify expected functionality.

=head2 follow_symlinks

 my $bool = $app->follow_symlinks;
 $app = $app->follow_symlinks(1);

If true, the application will follow symlinked directories when traversing the
distribution for modules. Defaults to false.

=head2 global

 my $bool = $app->global;
 $app = $app->global(1);

If true, the application will replace all version assignments found in each
particular module instead of just the first instance found. Defaults to false.

=head2 verbose

 my $bool = $app->verbose;
 $app = $app->verbose(1);

Enable progress messages to be printed to STDOUT. Defaults to false.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

 my $app = App::RewriteVersion->new;

Construct a new L<App::RewriteVersion> object.

=head2 rewrite_version

 my $bool = $app->rewrite_version(file => $file, version => $version);
 my $bool = $app->rewrite_version(file => $file, version => $version, is_trial => 1);

Rewrites the version of the file at C<$file> to C<$version> if it has a version
assignment in the form C<our $VERSION = '...';>. Returns true if the version
was rewritten, or false if no version assignment was found. Accepts the
following options:

=over

=item file

Relative or absolute path for the file to operate on, required.

=item is_trial

If true, C<# TRIAL> will be appended to the version assignment line when
rewriting. Defaults to false.

=item version

Version to set in file, required.

=back

=head2 rewrite_versions

 $app = $app->rewrite_versions(version => $version);
 $app = $app->rewrite_versions(dir => $dir, version => $version);
 $app = $app->rewrite_versions(version => $version, is_trial => 1);

Rewrites the versions of all perl files found in C<$dir> to C<$version> using
L</"rewrite_version">. Accepts the following options:

=over

=item dir

Relative or absolute path for the distribution directory to operate on.
Defaults to the current working directory.

=item is_trial

If true, C<# TRIAL> will be appended to the version assignment line when
rewriting. Defaults to false.

=item version

Version to set in perl files, required.

=back

=head2 update_versions

 $app = $app->update_versions;
 $app = $app->update_versions(dir => $path);
 $app = $app->update_versions(bump => sub { $_[0]+1 });
 $app = $app->update_versions(version_from => $module_file);
 $app = $app->update_versions(bump => 1, is_trial => 1);

Determines the version of the main module in the distribution and rewrites
versions in all perl files using L</"rewrite_versions">. Accepts the following
options:

=over

=item bump

If set to a code reference, it will be called with the current version as a
string, and will be expected to return the new version to use for rewriting.
Otherwise, a true value will use L<Version::Next> to determine the version to
set, and a false value will use the original unchanged version. Defaults to
false.

=item dir

Relative or absolute path for the distribution directory to operate on.
Defaults to the current working directory.

=item is_trial

If true, C<# TRIAL> will be appended to the version assignment line when
rewriting. Defaults to false.

=item version_from

File to use as main module for determining the current version, relative to the
distribution root directory. If unset, the main module filename will be guessed
from the distribution directory name, using heuristics similar to
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NameFromDirectory> and L<Dist::Zilla/"main_module">. The
C<V> environment variable will set the current version directly and override
this option.

=back

=head2 version_from

 my $version = $app->version_from($path);

Attempts to read version from the file at C<$path>. Returns C<undef> if no
version assignment was found.

Report any issues on the public bugtracker.
